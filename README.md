This was an in-class project where the goal was to connect to a server with the adafruit esp32 feather and transmit data from multiple perhipheral devices to the server while taking commands from the server itself via http.
This project utilizes FreeRTOS, and various libraries for multiple perhipheral devices.
The perhipherals used were: and HDC1080 temp/humidity sensor, Grove-Air-530 GPS, a stepper motor, a TSL2591 light sensor, and an SSD1306 OLED display.
